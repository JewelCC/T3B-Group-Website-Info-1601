                <p>
                    Danika Moris was born in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and in 1985.
                    Having grown up both next to the sea and in close proximity to two National Parks her love of the outdoors grew tremendously. 
                    Throughout her early life, Danika had salways been fascinated by images and how the world is represented through the eyes of others. 
                    The interest was cultivated during her teenage years and further developed when she opted to take her Bachelors Degree in Visual Arts.

                    Danika has exhibited consistently for the past twelve years both nationally and internationally. 
                    Danika’s recent abstract paintings seek to expose a delicate equilibrium between a sense of balance and visual calm and the tumult of painterly texture and surface tension.
