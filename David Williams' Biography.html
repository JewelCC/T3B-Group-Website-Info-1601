                <p>
                    Born in 1993 in Manzanilla, David Williams’ interest in the world of art began at a very young age. 
                    Inspired by the picturesque Manzi landscape that he called home, Williams’ began what would eventually become a phenomenal art career by creating simple drawings and sketches of the places and people he encountered from day to day. 
                    Williams later put down his pencil and developed a zeal for painting in oils.
